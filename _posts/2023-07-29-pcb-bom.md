If you're making a DIY electronics project that will be in use for long periods of time, it's probably a good idea to build it with something a bit more permanent than breadboards and jumper wires. There are a couple different ways of doing this, such as using [perfboards](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/blogs/2022/start-building-cleaner-perfboard-projects-using-these-simple-tips) that function in the same way as solderless breadboards, but let you permanently solder all your components in place. If you want something a bit cleaner looking or if you want to make the project more compact, you can also make a custom PCB for your project. Designing a PCB from the ground up can be a seem like a daunting task full of potential pitfalls, but with the right preparation it can be a fairly straightforward process. This series of tutorials will walk you through the process of designing a fully custom PCB from the ground up, starting with writing specifications for your project and ending with a fully assembled (and hopefully functional) PCB.

For this tutorial series, we'll walk through the design an construction of a small magnetic LED light. The light should be able to stick to a wide variety of magnetic surfaces, have multiple brightness settings, and a rechargeable battery. A simple project like this is a good starting point for learning how to design your own PCB, as it doesn't require any particularly complicated components or circuits, but still has enough features to be a decent example of the design process. Your project likely will be significantly different from this example, but the general process of decisions, planning, and design will be applicable to a wide variety of DIY projects.

# Writing Your Bill of Materials

Now that you have a general idea of what sort of components you'll need for your project, it's time to start putting together a bill of materials. A bill of materials, or BOM, is a list of all the components you'll need to build a project, including the number of each component that you'll need and a part number or other sourcing information. While it's possible to source all of your components from main-stream sites like amazon or ebay, it'll be much easier to find the exact components you need if you go to a dedicated electronics supplier. There are several good options out there for electronics suppliers, like [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/), [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/), [Newark](https://www.newark.com/), [Arrow](https://www.arrow.com/), and [LCSC](https://lcsc.com/). These suppliers have components broken out into categories based on their function, and allow you to use powerful search filters to find exactly the part you need. My personal favorite supplier is DigiKey because I find their search filters to be the easiest to use and have the most useful options. I'll use DigiKey as an example for this tutorial, but the general process will be the same for any major supplier.

## Finding Your Components

Walk through your component list, starting at the most "important" components like the microcontroller. For each component, you'll want to navigate to that category on the suppliers website and use the search filters to filter out as many components that don't meet your specifications as possible. You'll also want to filter out components that are out of stock to avoid multi-week lead times. When I'm searching with DigiKey, I also select their "datasheet" and "EDA/CAD models" filters. These aren't strictly necessary, but will make the process of designing the PCB simpler. Once I have all of the filters set up, I generally sort the remaining components by price and scroll down until I see one that catches my eye. Since this is a DIY project, the exact component choice isn't too important, so I'll usually just pick the cheapest option that meets my specifications.

Once you've found parts that meet your specifications, do a quick once-over of their data sheets to double check that there wasn't an error on the product listing. These should be fairly rare on a reputable site, but they do happen occasionally. If everything looks good, go ahead and make your BOM. I generally use DigiKey's built in list tool for my BOMs, but you could also use a spreadsheet or text document. The main things you'll want to have for your BOM is a part number and description for each component, the quantity of each component you'll need, and the price of each component. For projects where you're going to be soldering smaller components by hand, it's usually a decent idea to order a few extra components to account for "attrition" (ie, fried or lost components) during assembly.

## Example BOM

### Microcontroller

For our microcontroller, most of the filters that DigiKey provides are for features we won't need. The main filters we're interested in here are:

- **Number of I/O**: At least 2
- **Voltage - Supply (Vcc/Vdd)**: Select all the options that cover the 3.3V - 5V range
- **Oscillator Type**: Select all options that can use an internal oscillator
- **Mounting Type**: Surface mount to keep it small
- **Supplier Device Package**: We want to avoid anything that's _too_ small or hard to solder. SOIC is generally easy enough to handle, so select all the options that include SOIC
- **Stocking and Media**: Select in stock products only, and include products that include a datasheet and EDA/CAD models

This gives us a few different options, the cheapest of which is a large twenty pin [ATtiny40](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/ATTINY40-SU/2508027) chip. This would work, but would be a bit of overkill for this project. The next two option are the eight pin [ATtiny202](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/ATTINY202-SSNR/9554944) and [ATtiny402](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/ATTINY402-SSNR/9554946), which are both the same proce. Looking at the specs the only difference is the memory sizes, so we might as well pick the model with more memory.

**Final selection:** [ATtiny402](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/ATTINY402-SSNR/9554946)

### Battery

For the battery we want a rechargable or "secondary" battery, and can use the following filters to narrow down our options:

- **Voltage - Rated**: Minimum of 3.3V and maximum of 5V
- **Capacity**: Select all the options between 150mAh and 300mAh
- **Stocking and Media**: Select in stock products only, and include products that include a datasheet. Unfortunately, there aren't any products that include EDA/CAD models, so we'll have to skip that filter. The good news is that most batteries can be easily modeled as a rectangular box in CAD, so we can just use that instead.

The two cheapest options at the time of writing are a [290mAh battery from TinyCircuits](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/tinycircuits/ASR00007/7404517) and a [150mAh battery from Adafruit](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/adafruit-industries-llc/1317/5054547). According to the specs they're both roughly the same size, so we'll go with the larger capacity battery. The specs say the battery is terminated with a JST SH Connector, so we'll want to keep that in mind when we're selecting components for the battery charging circuit.

**Final selection:** [290mAh battery from TinyCircuits](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/tinycircuits/ASR00007/7404517)

### Battery Charging Circuit

DigiKey has a few pre-assembled battery charging boards, but they're all fairly large. To keep the size of the light down, we'll make our own charging circuit using a battery charging IC. We'll want to base the filters we use for this component based off of the specs of the battery we selected, so pull up the datasheet of the battery for cross-referencing. Batteries, especially lithium batteries, can be potentially dangerous if they aren't charged properly, so make sure you double check the specs of the battery and the charging IC to make sure they're compatible.

- **Number of Cells**: 1
- **Battery Chemistry**: Lithium Ion/Polymer
- **Charge Current - Max**: Anything between 150mA and 250mA. The battery can theoretically handle up to 290mA, but we don't need to charge as fast as possible
- **Battery Pack Voltage**: 4.2V. This is the maximum charge voltage of the battery, not the nominal voltage
- **Voltage - Supply (Max)**: We want to use USB for charging, which is 5V. To give ourselves a bit of safety margin, we'll select any options above 5.2V
- **Stocking and Media**: Select in stock products only, and include products that include a datasheet.

At the time of writing, these filters gave only six options to work with. Four use a ball grid array and one uses a TDFN package, both of which are an absolute pain to solder by hand. That leaves us with only one option, the [MP2603EJ-LF-Z](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/monolithic-power-systems-inc/MP2603EJ-LF-Z/9555323). Unfortunantly, this IC uses an TSOT23-5 package, which is also a bit of a pain to solder by hand, but is at least doable. It also doesn't have any EDA or CAD models listed on DigiKey, but since TSOT23-5 is a relatively common package we should be able to use a generic model as a stand in when it comes time to design the PCB.
